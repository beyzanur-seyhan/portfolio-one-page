This project is my first project in the "Front-End Developer" Bootcamp program within the scope of Hyper Front-End Developer organized by Tech Career for free.

This project is just a template and I have done the necessary editing.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Live Demo](https://beyzanur-seyhan.github.io/portfolio-one-page/) ‚ñ∂ Check out how the project looks

- The theme of this project is prepared before UI Kit template. ([Julia - One Page Portfolio HTML CSS Template](https://templatesjungle.gumroad.com/l/julia-onepage-portfolio))
- Necessary actions have been made for a single page. (Home page)

## What I Learned

Thanks to this study, I learned tools that I would never have thought of. These;

- Animation libraries
- Using a ready-made form submission provider tool
- Different icon source

## Used Languages Or Technologies

- Bootstrap Framework: https://getbootstrap.com/
- https://fonts.google.com/
- https://icon-sets.iconify.design/
