# PORTFOLIO ONE PAGE ðŸ‘©

![View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beyzanur-seyhan/portfolio-one-page/static/static/readme-files/header.gif)

This project is my first project in the "Front-End Development with Angular Bootcamp" program within the scope of Hyper organized by Tech Career for free.

This project is just a template and I have done the necessary editing.

- The theme of this project is prepared before UI Kit template. ([Julia - One Page Portfolio HTML CSS Template](https://templatesjungle.gumroad.com/l/julia-onepage-portfolio))
- Necessary actions have been made for a single page. 

## There are two sub-studies in this project, both static and Angular.

- [Browse to project with file content created with Angular](https://github.com/beyzanur-seyhan/portfolio-one-page/tree/main/angular)
